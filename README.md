**Dissertation Title**: A rising Tide? The Effects of Municipal Muslim Population Shares on Local Islamophobia in Switzerland.

**Supervisor**: Dr Moritz Marbach

**Dissertation Abstract**:

This paper examines the influence of municipal Muslim population shares on local Islamophobic attitudes in Switzerland. It overcomes previous data limitations by leveraging the results of the 2009 Minaret Construction Ban and the 2021 Face-Covering Ban referenda to measure changes in local Islamophobic sentiment. Employing first-difference models, our study indicates that increases in Muslim population shares generally reduce Islamophobia, with larger increments having a more pronounced effect. Additionally, our research is the first to differentiate between Arab and non-Arab Muslim impacts, finding that increases in the shares of non-Arab Muslims have a stronger mitigating effect on Islamophobic attitudes. In contrast, reductions in Muslim shares are found to increase Islamophobia, although significant effects are mostly confined to large decreases in shares and are less robust for Muslim sub-groups. Our results underscore the influence of the size and characteristics of local Muslim populations on Swiss Islamophobia dynamics and substantiate that these dynamics align more closely with Intergroup Contact Theory than Threat Theory. These findings hold important implications for policymakers, particularly in contexts of rising Muslim populations and the need for effective integration strategies.
