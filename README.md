**Dissertation Title**: A rising Tide? The Effects of Municipal Muslim Population Shares on Local Islamophobia in Switzerland.

**Supervisor**: Dr Moritz Marbach

**Abstract of the Dissertation**:

This paper examines the influence of municipal Muslim population shares on local Islamophobic attitudes in Switzerland. It overcomes previous data limitations by leveraging the results of the 2009 Minaret Construction Ban and the 2021 Face-Covering Ban referenda to measure changes in local Islamophobia. Employing first-difference models, our study indicates that increased Muslim population shares generally reduce Islamophobia, with larger increments having a more pronounced effect. In contrast, large reductions in Muslim shares are found to increase Islamophobia. Our research is also the first to differentiate between Arab and non-Arab Muslim impacts, finding that increases in the shares of non-Arab Muslims have a stronger mitigating effect on Islamophobic attitudes. These results underscore the influence of the characteristics of local Muslim populations on Islamophobia and substantiate the view that Swiss Islamophobia dynamics align more closely with Intergroup Contact Theory than Threat Theory. These findings hold important implications for policymakers, particularly in contexts of rising Muslim populations and the need for effective integration strategies.
